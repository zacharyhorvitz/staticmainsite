<p>
   My submission to the CS1400 TRON competition placed second out of 22 teams. The class environment was a modified version of the original <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)'>TRON game</a>, where players compete to wall off their opponent.
   My implementation appled MiniMax with Alpha-Beta pruning, and evalued states with the Voronoi heuristic weighted towards power-ups. To handle stochastic power-up effects, I modified the vanilla MiniMax algorithm into Expecti-Max by running multiple expansions for each random state transition, anding compute the value of an action in expectation.
