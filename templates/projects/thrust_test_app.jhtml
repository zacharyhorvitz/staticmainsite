    For David Kerter's graduate Anthropology Demography course, I collected over 200 thousand geo-tagged Twitter posts related to "Abortion," and clustered regions at the state and county level. My results indicate that Twitter discourses correlate with both public support for legalizing abortion at the state level and reproductive policy at the city level. These discourses appear to capture the circulation of tweets through ideological networks, and messages that articulate opinions through pro-life and pro-choice frames. Additionally, my analyses indicates that these data-driven approaches, while far from perfect, have the potential to augment existing demographic data, and aid advocacy groups by identifying regions with dissonance between grassroots sentiment and law.
